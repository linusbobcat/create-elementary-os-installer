# Create elementary OS Installer

An Applescript app for creating elementary OS Installer USB drives. It uses dd as a backend. It should work on Mac OS X Tiger and above, although it has only been tested on OS X El Capitan. The resulting USB drive should boot on Macs that fullfil the system requirements, as well as any USB booting capable PC.

This project consists of two apps, "Create elementary OS Installer" and "Restore USB Drive." The second app restores elementary OS Installers on El Capitan and above.

If you have a recent Mac, just download the most [recent release](https://github.com/linusbobcat/create-elementary-os-installer/releases) and follow the built in instructions. View the [wiki page](https://github.com/linusbobcat/create-elementary-os-installer/wiki/Installation-Instructions) for complete instructions.
