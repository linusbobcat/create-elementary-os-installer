# Create elementary OS Installer

An Applescript app for creating elementary OS Installer USB drives. It uses dd as a backend. It should run on Mac OS X Snow Leopard and above. The resulting USB drive should boot on Macs that fulfill the system requirements, as well as any USB booting capable PC.

Included in releases is a copy of "Restore USB Drive." This reformats elementary OS USB drives back to normal on El Capitan and above. Restore USB Drive is maintained [here](https://github.com/linusbobcat/restore-linux-usb-drive)

If you have a recent Mac, just download the most [recent release](https://github.com/linusbobcat/create-elementary-os-installer/releases) and follow the built in instructions. View the [wiki page](https://github.com/linusbobcat/create-elementary-os-installer/wiki/Instructions) for complete instructions.

**Do note that the main branch is the development branch. Use it as your own risk.**
